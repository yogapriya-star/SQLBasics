DATA are 3 types they are:
  *Structured Data
  *Un-Structured Data
  *Semi-Structured Data

Structured Data => Data is defined in a structured.
    => [Text, Number, Date]

Un-Structured Data => information that either does not have a pre-defined data model or is not organized in a pre-defined manner.
    => [Digital photos, audio, and video files]

Semi-Structured Data => Semi-structured data is typically characterized by the use of metadata or tags that provide additional information about the data elements.
    => [XML , JSON, E-mails and Web pages]  

There are 4 types of database
    => Hierarchical Database
    => Relational Database
    => Non-Relational Database
    => Object oriented database
  
Relational Database Management System/ SQL Databases 
    => It is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.
    => SQL => Standard Query Language designed for Relational Database.
  Types of Relational Models
    => The One-to-Many Model
    => The One-to-One Model
    => The Many-to-Many Model
    => The Many-to-One Model

Relational databases need ACID characteristics. ACID refers to four essential properties: 
    - Atomicity 
    - Consistency 
    - Isolation
    - Durability

Example of RDBMS 
    IBM, Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQLServer and PostgreSQL.

  
Non-Relational Database Management System/ NoSQL Databases 
    => It is a database that does not use the tabular schema of rows and columns found in most traditional database systems.
    => NoSQL => Not Only Standard Query Language designed for Non-Relational Database.
  
There are four different types of NoSQL databases.
    => Document-oriented database
    => Key-Value Stores
    => Wide-Column Stores
    => Graph Stores

Example of RDBMS 
    MongoDB, Redis.

SQL Commands
    SQL commands are instructions. It is used to communicate with the database. It is also used to perform specific tasks, functions, and queries of data.
    There are five types of SQL commands: 
        => DDL
        => DML
        => DCL
        => TCL
        => DQL

Data Definition Language (DDL)
      - CREATE
      - ALTER
      - DROP
      - TRUNCATE
  
Data Manipulation Language (DML)
      - INSERT
      - UPDATE
      - DELETE
  
Data Control Language (DCL)
      - Grant
      - Revoke

Transaction Control Language (TCL)
      - COMMIT
      - ROLLBACK
      - SAVEPOINT

Data Query Language (DQL)
      - SELECT

SQL Operator 
  => SQL Arithmetic Operators  [+, -, *, /, %]
  => SQL Comparison Operators  [=, !=, <>, >, <, >=, <=, !<, !>]
  => SQL Logical Operators     [ALL, AND, ANY, BETWEEN, IN, NOT, OR, EXISTS, LIKE]

DBMS Architecture 
    => 1-Tier Architecture - In this architecture, the database is directly available to the user. It means the user can directly sit on the DBMS and uses it.
    => 2-Tier Architecture - The 2-Tier architecture is same as basic client-server. In the two-tier architecture, applications on the client end can directly communicate with the database at the server side. For this interaction, API's like: ODBC, JDBC are used.
    => 3-Tier Architecture - The 3-Tier architecture contains another layer between the client and server. In this architecture, client can't directly communicate with the server.

Types of keys:
    1. Primary key
    2. Candidate key
    3. Super Key
    4. Foreign key
    5. Alternate key
    6. Composite key
    7. Artificial key
